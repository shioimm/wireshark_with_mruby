 What is Wireshark?

 Getting Wireshark

  Wireshark source code and installation packages are available from

  Vendor-supplied Packages

   Most Linux and Unix vendors supply their own Wireshark packages. You
   can usually install or upgrade Wireshark using the package management
   system specific to that platform. A list of third-party packages can
   be found on the download page[1] on the Wireshark web site.

 File Locations

  Wireshark and TShark look in several different locations for
  preference files, plugins, SNMP MIBS, and RADIUS dictionaries. These
  locations vary from platform to platform. You can use "Help › About
  Wireshark › Folders" or `tshark -G folders` to find the default
  locations on your system.

 Getting Help

  The User’s Guide, manual pages and various other documentation can be
  found at https://www.wireshark.org/docs/

  Community support is available on Wireshark’s Q&A site[2] and on the
  wireshark-users mailing list. Subscription information and archives
  for all of Wireshark’s mailing lists can be found on the web site[3].

  Bugs and feature requests can be reported on the issue tracker[4].

  You can learn protocol analysis and meet Wireshark’s developers at
  SharkFest[5].
